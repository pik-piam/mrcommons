\arguments{
\item{sectoral}{"area_harvested" returns croparea aggregated to FAO products,
"ProductionItem" unaggregated ProdSTAT items,
"FoodBalanceItem" Food Balance Sheet categories,
"kcr" MAgPIE items, and "lpj" LPJmL items}

\item{physical}{if TRUE the sum over all crops agrees with the cropland area per country}

\item{cellular}{if TRUE: calculates cellular MAgPIE crop area for all magpie croptypes.
Crop area from LUH2 crop types (c3ann, c4ann, c3per, c4per, cnfx)
are mapped to MAgpIE crop types using mappingLUH2cropsToMAgPIEcrops.csv.
Harvested areas of FAO weight area within a specific LUH crop type
to divide into MAgPIE crop types.}

\item{cells}{Switch between "magpiecell" (59199) and "lpjcell" (67420)}

\item{irrigation}{If true: cellular areas are returned separated
into irrigated and rainfed (see setup in calcLUH2v2)}
}

\description{
Returns harvested areas of individual crops from FAOSTAT.
Total harvested areas can be lower or higher than arable
land because of multicropping or fallow land.
Rice areas are distributed to flooded LUH areas. Additional FAOSTAT
rice areas are distributed based on country shares.
