#' calcGDPppp
#' 
#' Merges time series of GDP in Purchase Power Parity (PPP) of International
#' Dollars of the year 2005.  The source is selected in the config file. See
#' \code{\link{calcGDPpppPast}} for past datasets, and
#' \code{\link{calcGDPpppFuture}} for future datasets. The time series are
#' merged via the growth rates. The first year of the future scenarios
#' determines the merging point. All data is calibrated either to the "past" or
#' the "future" dataset as specified in "getConfig()$calc$PopulationCalib".
#' \itemize{ \item \code{WDI}: The PPP estimate from the World Developmnet
#' Indicators (WDI) are supplemented by values for Argentina, Syria and Somalia
#' which are missing in the database. The values were taken from World Bank.
