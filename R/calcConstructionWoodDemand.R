  ## 35 year demand = (pop diff in 2050-2105) * McW * CW * PR
  ## McW is from Supplementary Table 3   and Supplementary Table 4)
  ## CW is 0.5 (carbon in dry matter)
  ## PR is papers scenarios 0.1,0.5,0.9 etc

  ## Create MWC --- See Table 3 and Table 4 in SI https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-019-0462-4
