    # IPCC methodologies are not in line with the Nr surplus in various regions. Sometimes, volatilization and leaching exceed the surplus.
    # Also, a change in NUE does not change the emission factors.
    # Emission factors in IPCC were estimated for average management conditions in 2006 and rather for global estimates.
    # Finally, the emissions only include fertilization-induced emissions, not total emissions that include also the natural emissions
    #
    # In order to reach emission factors that scale with the Nr surplus, we used the following steps:
    #   - We estimate NH3 NOx NO3 and N2O emissions based on the IPCC tier 1 methodology on country level.
    #   - We add non-anthropogenic emissions as they are not included in IPCC
    #   - We add indirect emissions from atmospheric deposition, which are attribtued to the source in IPCC
    #   - We estimate globally for the year 2005 the share of denitrification as 1-(NOx,NH3,)
    #   - We calculate N2 emissions applying these global shares for N2O and N2 to the national N surplus
    #   - We rescale all emission types by one factor for each country such that the sum of all emissions is equal to the Nr surplus.
    #   - We estimate globally for the year 2005 the share of direct N2O emission in denitrification using IPCC tier 1 methodology to subdivide denitrification into N2O and N2
