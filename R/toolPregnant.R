#' @description extra intake kcal/day for pregnant women. The number of pregnant women is 
#' computed through the number of 0 year old children each year (Lutz dataset).
#' According to Human energy requirments , Fao (Rome, 2004) , a woman requires an additional
#' food of 845 kcal/day and 675 kcal/day of food on average furing her pregancy and lactation 
#' period respectively. According to Naegele?s rule, the mean gestation period is 280 days (40 weeks)
#' and the lactation period 6 month (25 weeks).
#' @param demo demo is the population divided by sex male (M) , female (F) and both (B)
#' and divided by 8 age classes: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, AG1 (20-29), AG2 (30-59), AG3(60-79), AG4(80+) 
#' @param reproductive reproductive age classes (on which the energy requiremetns for newborns are distributed)
